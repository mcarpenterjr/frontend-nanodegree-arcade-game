===============================

    An HTML5 project the revolves around the <canvas> element and JavaScript.
The version or theme for my Frogger style game is Unicorns and Narwahls, I know
pretty freakin' awesome.

PLAYING THE GAME-

It's simple, using the arrow keys, or WASD navigate the unicorn block by block 
to the grass area. Each completed attempt is worth 100 points, each collision
with a narhawl costs you a life, you have 5.

INSTALLING THE GAME TO YOUR SERVER-

1) DOWNLOAD THE PACKAGE FROM HERE --> https://codeload.github.com/xXSirenSxOpusXx/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/zip/master

2) extract the zip file to the folder in which our Unicorns and Narhawls will live.

3) modify the links in the footer to reflect your personal social media profiles.

4) launch index.html!
